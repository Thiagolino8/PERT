# PERT

Program Evaluation and Review Technique

## What is PERT?

PERT is a project management technique that helps estimate the time required to complete a task or project. The technique uses a probabilistic approach to estimate the completion time of a task. Instead of providing a single time estimate, PERT uses three values:

- Optimistic Time: This number is highly optimistic. It represents the time it would take to complete the task if everything goes perfectly.
- Most Likely Time: This number is the most likely to occur. It means there's a 50% chance of completing the task in this time.
- Pessimistic Time: This number is highly pessimistic. It includes everything that can go wrong while performing this task (except for hurricanes, nuclear wars, black holes, and other catastrophes).

Time Estimate = (Optimistic Time + (4 x Most Likely Time) + Pessimistic Time) / 6

## Example

Optimistic Time: 5 days
Most Likely Time: 7 days
Pessimistic Time: 10 days

R = (5 + (4 x 7) + 10) / 6
R = (5 + 28 + 10) / 6
R = 43 / 6
R = 7.17 days

Therefore, the estimate for these tasks is seven days and 17 hours.
